"For example, other operating systems look at the name of a file to determine"
" which program should open it, then immediately attempt to open it. That "
"design makes it easy for an intruder to attack a computer. <span name"
"=\"distro-name\"></span> opens a file based on what the file is, not based "
"on its name. So even if a malicious program disguises its identity by using "
"the name \"Last Will and Testament.txt\" <span name=\"distro-name\"></span> "
"will recognize the file as a program. The system provides a warning that the"
" file is not a text file, but that it is a program that will be run if you "
"give it permission to continue. To be extra secure, <span name=\"distro-"
"name\"></span> requires you to provide your administrator password before "
"that permission is granted. Every single time."
