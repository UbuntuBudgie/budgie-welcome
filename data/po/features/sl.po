"<span name=\"distro-name\"></span> is a modern computer operating system, "
"with an attractive and easy to understand user interface. Its update manager"
" keeps not only the operating system itself, but all of its installed "
"applications updated to the current release. The operating system is more "
"secure, and better supported than operating systems that come pre-installed "
"on most home computer hardware today."

"<span name=\"distro-name\"></span> is designed with security in mind. Unlike"
" operating systems that update only once a month, <span name=\"distro-"
"name\"></span> receives updates continuously. The updates include security "
"patches for <span name=\"distro-name\"></span> and all of its components. "
"Security updates for all of its installed applications are also provided on "
"the same schedule. This ensures that you have the latest protection for all "
"of your computer's software -- as soon as it's available!"

"<span name=\"distro-name\"></span> can get viruses and other infections... "
"but it is rare. Rapid and timely updates make it difficult for viruses, root"
" kits and other malware to be installed and run without conscious "
"intervention by you, the user. Even if you do accidentally invite in an "
"infection, chances are it's designed to attack Windows and won't do much, if"
" any damage to <span name=\"distro-name\"></span>."

"Another significant security feature of <span name=\"distro-name\"></span> "
"is that its users are not superusers by default. Superusers (also known as "
"\"root\" users or administrators) on any computer system have permission to "
"do anything they want, including the ability to damage the system."

"For example, other operating systems look at the name of a file to determine"
" which program should open it, then immediately attempt to open it. That "
"design makes it easy for an intruder to attack a computer. <span "
"name=\"distro-name\"></span> opens a file based on what the file is, not "
"based on its name. So even if a malicious program disguises its identity by "
"using the name \"Last Will and Testament.txt\" <span name=\"distro-"
"name\"></span> will recognize the file as a program. The system provides a "
"warning that the file is not a text file, but that it is a program that will"
" be run if you give it permission to continue. To be extra secure, <span "
"name=\"distro-name\"></span> requires you to provide your administrator "
"password before that permission is granted. Every single time."
