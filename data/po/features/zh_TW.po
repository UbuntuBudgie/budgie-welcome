"For example, other operating systems look at the name of a file to determine"
" which program should open it, then immediately attempt to open it. That "
"design makes it easy for an intruder to attack a computer. Ubuntu Budgie "
"opens a file based on what the file is, not based on its name. So even if a "
"malicious program disguises its identity by using the name \"Last Will and "
"Testament.txt\" Ubuntu Budgie will recognize the file as a program. The "
"system provides a warning that the file is not a text file, but that it is a"
" program that will be run if you give it permission to continue. To be extra"
" secure, Ubuntu Budgie requires you to provide your administrator password "
"before that permission is granted. Every single time."

"例如，其他操作系统通过查看文件的名称来确定应该由哪个程序打开它，然后立即尝试打开它。这种设计使入侵者很容易攻击计算机。Ubuntu Budgie "

"也会将该文件识别为程序。系统会发出警告，说明该文件不是文本文件，而是一个程序，如果您允许它继续运行，就会运行该程序。为了更加安全，每一次 Ubuntu "
