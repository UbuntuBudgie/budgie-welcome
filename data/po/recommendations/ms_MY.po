"<strong>Snap</strong> is a new generation application packaging format "
"developed by <em>Canonical</em>. Even though it was initially developed just"
" for different Ubuntu platforms, currently it works in many other GNU/Linux "
"distributions. It will help application developers to provide a unified "
"package that can work on different platforms. By using snap package format, "
"applications can have their own version of libraries and there is no need to"
" worry about libraries installed in underlying operating system. Snap "
"packages enable developers to bring much newer versions of apps to <span "
"name=\"distro-name\"></span>. Newer versions of KDE, GNOME, browsers or "
"other desktop environment apps will usually build easily on older LTS "
"releases but the complexities of packaging and providing updates have "
"prevented us from delivering them in the past."
