            <h2>Modern and Full-Featured</h2>
            <p>Ubuntu Budgie is a modern computer operating system, with an
              attractive and easy to understand user interface. Its update
              manager keeps not only the operating system itself, but all of its
              installed applications updated to the current release. The
              operating system is more secure, and better supported than
              operating systems that come pre-installed on most home computer
              hardware today.</p>

            <p>Using Ubuntu Budgie provides you with the freedom to run a
              complete, full-featured operating system, pre-configured with
              most, if not all, of the applications you will need for your daily
              computing - or to change anything about the way it looks, the way
              it works, or the applications it runs to suit your taste.</p>

            <p>Ubuntu Budgie is designed with security in mind. Unlike operating
              systems that update only once a month, Ubuntu Budgie receives
              updates continuously. The updates include security patches for
              Ubuntu Budgie and all of its components. Security updates for all of
              its installed applications are also provided on the same schedule.
              This ensures that you have the latest protection for all of your
              computer's software -- as soon as it's available!</p>

            <p>Ubuntu Budgie can get viruses and other infections... but it is
              rare. Rapid and timely updates make it difficult
              for viruses, root kits and other malware to be installed and run
              without conscious intervention by you, the user. Even if you do
              accidentally invite in an infection, chances are it's designed to
              attack Windows and won't do much, if any damage to Ubuntu Budgie.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="col-md-10">
            <p>Another significant security feature of Ubuntu Budgie is that its
              users are not superusers by default. Superusers (also known as "root"
              users or administrators) on any computer system have permission to do
              anything they want, including the ability to damage the system.</p>
            <p>For example, other operating systems look at the name of a file
              to determine which program should open it, then immediately
              attempt to open it. That design makes it easy for an intruder to
              attack a computer. Ubuntu Budgie opens a file based on what the file
              is, not based on its name. So even if a malicious program
              disguises its identity by using the name "Last Will and
              Testament.txt" Ubuntu Budgie will recognize the file as a program.
              The system provides a warning that the file is not a text file,
              but that it is a program that will be run if you give it
              permission to continue. To be extra secure, Ubuntu Budgie requires
              you to provide your administrator password before that permission
              is granted. Every single time.</p>

            <h2>Powerful Applications</h2>
            <p>While budgie-desktop provides the essential user interface to
              control and use a computer, Ubuntu Budgie adds a collection of
              additional applications to turn your computer into a truly
              powerful workstation.</p>
